# 🔗 ChainProof  
### Blockchain for Intellectual Property & Copyright Protection

**ChainProof** is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to establish transparent, immutable, and verifiable records of intellectual property (IP) ownership and copyright claims. It provides creators, inventors, and organizations a secure way to timestamp, register, and prove ownership of their work.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Immutable Proof of Ownership**  
  Every asset registered on ChainProof is cryptographically hashed and stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof ownership records.

- **Timestamping**  
  Automatically generates and stores a verifiable timestamp to prove the exact time of registration.

- **Decentralized Verification**  
  Anyone can independently verify ownership records and metadata without relying on a central authority.

- **Support for Multiple File Types**  
  Register and protect images, documents, music, video, code, and more.

- **Smart Contracts for Licensing**  
  Use customizable smart contracts to define and automate licensing terms and royalty payments.

- **Audit Trail**  
  Maintain a complete historical log of asset modifications, transfers, and licensing agreements.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Uploads an Asset**  
   The file (or its metadata/fingerprint) is hashed locally and never stored in full on-chain to maintain privacy.

2. **Asset Registration**  
   The hash, timestamp, user ID (public key), and metadata are recorded on the blockchain.

3. **Verification and Access**  
   Anyone can search or verify the asset by uploading a file or entering a registration ID.

4. **Optional Licensing**  
   Asset owners can attach smart contracts to define usage rights and collect payments.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / Polygon / Hyperledger (configurable)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (ERC-721 or custom IP token standard)
- **Frontend**: React + Web3.js / Ethers.js
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express + IPFS for decentralized file storage
- **Database (for off-chain metadata)**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- MetaMask wallet or similar
- Ganache (for local testing)
- Truffle / Hardhat (for smart contract deployment)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/chainproof.git
cd chainproof
npm install
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run start
```

### Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat deploy --network localhost
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- File contents are not stored on-chain; only hashes and metadata are.
- Optional use of IPFS or Filecoin for decentralized storage.
- All transactions and proofs are cryptographically verifiable.
