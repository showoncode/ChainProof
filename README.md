# 🔗 ChainProof

**Blockchain for Intellectual Property & Copyright Protection**

ChainProof is a decentralized platform that uses blockchain technology to establish transparent, immutable, and verifiable records of intellectual property (IP) and copyright claims. Built with Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, ChainProof ensures creators and organizations can securely register, license, and verify ownership of their digital assets.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Immutable Proof of Ownership**  
  Assets are hashed and recorded immutably on-chain, creating tamper-proof ownership records.

- **Timestamping**  
  Automatically timestamps registrations to establish exact ownership dates.

- **Decentralized Verification**  
  Anyone can verify ownership and metadata without relying on a central authority.

- **Multi-format Support**  
  Protect various asset types: images, documents, audio, video, source code, etc.

- **Smart Contracts for Licensing**  
  Attach Clarity-based smart contracts to define licensing terms and automate royalty payments.

- **Audit Trail**  
  Maintains a full record of asset modifications, transfers, and licensing agreements.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Uploads an Asset**  
   The file is hashed locally using SHA-256. File content is never stored on-chain.

2. **Asset Registration**  
   The hash, metadata, user’s wallet address, and a timestamp are recorded on the Stacks blockchain.

3. **Verification**  
   Anyone can verify a claim by submitting the original file or hash to check against blockchain records.

4. **Optional Licensing**  
   Attach a Clarity smart contract to define licensing terms, enforce usage rights, and automate payments.

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Hiro Wallet
- [Clarinet](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity/clarinet/) (Clarity contract dev tool)
- IPFS CLI (optional for decentralized storage)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/chainproof.git
cd chainproof
npm install
````

### Running Locally

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run start
```

Start the backend API server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Deploy Smart Contracts with Clarinet

```bash
cd contracts
clarinet check          # Type check the Clarity contract
clarinet test           # Run unit tests
clarinet integrate      # Run integration tests
clarinet deploy         # Deploy to localnet
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

* Asset contents are **never stored on-chain**—only SHA-256 hashes and relevant metadata.
* IPFS/Filecoin support available for **decentralized, off-chain file storage**.
* Proofs are **cryptographically verifiable** via Clarity and blockchain explorers.
* Smart contracts are **auditable** and open-source.
